I've known Gavin for 2 years and we worked together on our Systems Design capstone project at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. On top of being an incredibly hard worker, with dedication, and determination to meet deadlines, he is also one of the most skilled programmers that I have ever had the pleasure of working alongside. I have no doubt that he would make an excellent addition to any team looking for high-value technical skills and determination.
