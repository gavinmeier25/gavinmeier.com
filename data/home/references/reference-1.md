It is a pleasure to recommend Mr. Gavin Meier who is a recent graduate of the Information Systems (IS) department at the University of Missouri – St. Louis. I have known Gavin for over two years as an outstanding student as well as a leader of the IS Programming Club. He helped organize as well as participated in the IS department’s events, including a 48-hour hackathon – UMSL|Hack in February 2018, during which he built a fully functional application leveraging an API.

Gavin’s strong technical skills earned him an internship as an entry level developer at Bayer in Spring 2018 where he continued to develop his abilities and interpersonal skills. He further refined these skills at TDK Technologies in fall 2018. During the capstone course of his BSIS degree in fall 2018, his team completed one of the largest projects ever done in the class, a large scale enterprise web application using agile development techniques.

From my interactions with Gavin, I can vouch that he is a natural leader with strong technical skills and exceptional work ethics who always steps up to help and mentor others. He is always eager to learn and stay current with new technologies including Blockchain and web applications.

Gavin is very personable and popular with his peers. He has excellent communication skills, commits himself whole-heartedly to projects, and gets things done. His positive attitude, strong work ethics, humble demeanor, and willingness to go the extra step make him stand out. I have no doubt that he will be immensely successful in any endeavor he undertakes and wish him the best.
